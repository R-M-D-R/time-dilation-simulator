# time-dilation-simulator
Experience time dilation due to gravity (general relativity)

This is a simulator to let you see how proximity to a mass can affect the passage of time.

In this simulation, there are two people: one person on Earth and one person in a rocket ship. Both are 20 years old. In addition to this,
there are two calendars: one calendar representing the date on Earth and one calendar representing the date on the spaceship.

Once you are running the simulator, use the left and right arrow keys to move the spaceship. If you fly far enough to the right, you will
approach a black hole. As you get closer and closer to the black hole, you will notice that the two calendars will no longer run at the
same rate. (You can toggle between perspectives by hitting the TAB key.)

To run this, you will need Python and a graphics package called Pygame. Just put all of the files into the same directory and run the
Python file.

Enjoy!
